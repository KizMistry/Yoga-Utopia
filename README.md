## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.



The Yoga Utopia Home, Yoga, Meditation and Mental Health page all work as intened.
I personally tested all pages and sections of Yoga Utopia; Some of the main testing points included:
  - page navigation
  - testing all clickable links
  - hovering cursor over clickable links i.e. Navigation Bar, Footer Icons, What we Offer boxes, Logo etc.
  - responsiveness of each section, image, video, text, navigation bar and footer by resizing the browsers display area
  - test the playback of the embeded youtube videos
  - test hamburger menu responsiveness when screen size is changed

The website is fully responsive to all devices and screen sizes.

The website was shared with family and friends to test the websites usage and no problems/issues were mentioned in their feedback.

There is a minor bug with the hamburger menu: the area of the clickable button does not cover the full surface area of the hamburger icon displayed on the devices screen.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
